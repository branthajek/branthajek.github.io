            <p>I'm a web developer based in Portland, OR.</p>
                
            <p>I enjoy working with people in collaborative environments - learning from others is essential. Learning from mistakes is too.</p>

            <p>I'm always trying to improve; outside of work time I am regularly learning new skills or practicing skills I already have. Things I am consistently interested in learning more about include JS frameworks, full stack development, modern CSS, software design patterns, unit testing, front-end tools, accessibility, and generally how I can be a better developer.</p>
